## Read Me 
Hi there,
Firstly, I have not used riverpod before, therefore I searched for the architecture types which is suitable with riverpod and decided that “presentation – domain – data” is the most effective and efficient arch type. 

- Inside presentation: widgets, pages, and providers; 
- Inside domain: services;
- Inside data: remote or local data sources;

I used chatGPT for generating questions with 3 options and asked for suitable colorschemes for a quiz app.

I have finished this task within 5 days and this is my time management for this task:

- I recieved the task at thursday evening and made a quick research for state management with riverpod,
- I started at the task at friday morning with the question card structures
- On saturday I finished the logics between swiping pages(also timer logics) and question indicator. 
- Sunday off
- Monday I designed a basic welcoming page and mentioned the rules of quiz and added a button for starting the quiz
- Tuesday I desinged a results page which displays your score and allows you take quiz again
- Wednesday I took a time for debugging and tests.

If you have further questions you can contact me anytime :)
Thanks <3
